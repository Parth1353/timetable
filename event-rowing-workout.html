	<div>Don’t like running? You don’t have to. Even though treadmills are great, they’re not the only piece of cardio equipment that can get you in tip-top shape. Rowing machines will bring you a wealth of strength and conditioning benefits — without all that repetitive impact on your joints.

		Rowing is a low impact, functional exercise that is relatively easy to learn. It’s a great tool for building well-rounded fitness, and you can use it in both high-intensity training sessions and low-intensity recovery workouts. Learning to set-up the rower and execute the proper technique is essential to getting the most out of this machine — and mastering a diverse array of workouts can help a lot, too.</div>
