	<div>In between each of the strength moves—starting with weighted squats and ending with leg lifts—Gobins suggests flowing through Sun Salutation A. (If you're not familiar with Sun Salutation A, learn how to do it here.). This will help you smoothly transition between exercises, and it serves as active rest between strength sets. If the sun salutation is a little too much for you, then pause in Downward Facing Dog for about five breaths between each strength exercise.</div>
